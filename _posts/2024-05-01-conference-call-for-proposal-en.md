This year's Code4Lib JAPAN Conference will be held online over two days, Saturday, September 7th and Sunday, September 8th, 2024, following last year's conference.
We invite presentations on a variety of initiatives, including software applications in libraries, archives, and museums, and new ideas related to use of community-based library resources and technologies.

[Code4Lib](https://code4lib.org/) (code for libraries) is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers, designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on technology stuff.
[Code4Lib JAPAN](https://www.code4lib.jp/) was established with the aim of spreading the Code4Lib movement in Japan in 2010, and has held annual conferences since 2013.

### Purpose of the event

The Code4Lib JAPAN Conference is an event where librarians, technologists, and all other people involved in libraries, technology, the Web, and IT gather to introduce ideas and tools, share advanced approaches, and meet and connect with each other.
Since the first conference held in Minamisanriku Town, Miyagi Prefecture in the summer of 2013, a total of nine conferences have been held, and many cutting-edge and unique initiatives related to library services and information technology have been introduced. In addition, the discussions at the past conferences have led to new developments such as digital archives and book image databases.

This year, we will continue to hold a variety of sessions, including keynote speeches, regular presentations, pre-conferences (tutorials), lightning talks, and breakout sessions, to share numerous initiatives and deepen exchanges among participants.

### Call for proposals

**Application form**: **[https://bit.ly/c4ljp24-proposal](https://bit.ly/c4ljp24-proposal)**

Please use the form above to submit your presentation.

There are three types of presentations: regular presentations, pre-conferences, and lightning talks.

- Regular presentations (in Japanese): Each presentation has 15 minutes of presentation time and 5 minutes of Q&A time. We plan to accept about 8 proposals.

- Pre-conferences (Tutorials): These are sessions where participants can learn new skills related to libraries and technology from each other. You are free to plan your own session (about 2 hours), for example, workshops where participants can actually discuss a specific topic, and hands-on seminar where participants can work with specific technologies and tools. They will be held in the morning, September 3rd in Japan Standard Time. We plan to accept up to two proposals. See: [last year's preconferences](https://wiki.code4lib.jp/wiki/C4ljp2023/preconference)
