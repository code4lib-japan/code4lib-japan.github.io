This year's Code4Lib JAPAN Conference will be held online over two days, Saturday, September 2nd and Sunday, September 3rd, 2023, following last year's conference.
We invite presentations on a variety of initiatives, including software applications in libraries, archives, and museums, and new ideas related to use of community-based library resources and technologies.

[Code4Lib](https://code4lib.org/) (code for libraries) is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers, designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on technology stuff.
[Code4Lib JAPAN](https://www.code4lib.jp/) was established with the aim of spreading the Code4Lib movement in Japan in 2010, and has held annual conferences since 2013.

See: [Past conferences](/conference/)

Libraries and other sites continue to make various efforts to respond to the issues on COVID-19.
If this conference can create even a small opportunity for people in this situation to connect online and share their technical know-how and awareness of issues, it will serve our purpose.
Of course, as in the past conferences, the Code4Lib JAPAN welcomes presentations on a wide variety of issues and technical topics.

The event will be held using Zoom and Slack.
Please note that those who apply presentations should be able to use the Zoom environment.

### Purpose of the event

The Code4Lib JAPAN Conference is an event where librarians, technologists, and all other people involved in libraries, technology, the Web, and IT gather to introduce ideas and tools, share advanced approaches, and meet and connect with each other.
Since the first conference held in Minamisanriku Town, Miyagi Prefecture in the summer of 2013, a total of nine conferences have been held, and many cutting-edge and unique initiatives related to library services and information technology have been introduced. In addition, the discussions at the past conferences have led to new developments such as digital archives and book image databases.

This year, we will continue to hold a variety of sessions, including keynote speeches, regular presentations, pre-conferences (tutorials), lightning talks, and breakout sessions, to share numerous initiatives and deepen exchanges among participants.

### Call for proposals

There are three types of presentations: regular presentations, pre-conferences, and lightning talks.
